The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/11489,+1 540-206-2358,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/norfolk/1901-colley-avenue,+1 757-622-6200,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Craft is food that inspires and surprises the palate. Craft is service that delights and exceeds expectations. Most importantly, craft means championing love and integrity in every aspect of what we do. Craft beer, for some time, was an exclusive culture; it existed in the basements of homebrewers, on niche blogs, and in obscure, tucked away bars. For outsiders, craft beer can be intimidating. In fact, we're still learning. After all, it's a big brewhouse out there. City Tap believes that craft beer should be accessible to everyone. In Philadelphia 2010, we saw an opportunity to bring craft beer to the people. With a wide, open bar, a huge selection of taps, an extremely readable draft list, and regional (dare we say exceptional) cuisine, our sudsy dream became a reality.",,,https://www.citytap.com/location/loudoun/,+1 571-510-3850,american,burger,0.0,0,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/virginia-beach/300-28th-st,+1 757-425-4666,american,"salad, dinner, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that were just plain embarrassing to them today, the cousins decided to try something a bit unique, A/B testing their way to the perfect cookie. They would take the exact same cookie, change out one ingredient like chocolate chips and randomly visit local gas stations and grocery stores simply asking one question ""Which one of these two cookies is the best?"" They continued this testing on ingredients and cooking methods until they came up with what they believe is the world's best chocolate chip cookie.The very first Crumbl opened in Logan, UT while Sawyer was attending Utah State University (go Aggies). Since then the franchise has expanded to 820+ locations in 49 states and Canada, each continuing to spread warm, fresh, delicious cookies to Crumblrs everywhere",,,https://crumblcookies.com/vawinchester,+1 540-686-1092,,dessert,1.0,0,0,0

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/7872,+1 540-213-2200,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/1059,+1 540-371-3544,,,0.0,0,1,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/suffolk/6550-hampton-roads-parkway,+1 757-483-6355,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Early in 1983, Ron and Tina Pack were on a boat cruise with friends in the upper Chesapeake Bay. During that cruise, it became apparent that their newly adopted town of Smithfield was every bit as nice as the popular destination points of the upper bay communities. It became their dream to provide a truly exceptional experience for their guests and to establish Smithfield as a historic destination just as nice as neighboring waterfront communities. In 1994 The Lighthouse was added, and then In 2001 and 2003 respectively, a new generation of Pack's, Randy and Brian, became fully involved with the business. With the addition of these two brothers, they expanded Smithfield Station with the creation of The Lodge with luxury suites, conference space and boardwalk shops.",,,http://smithfieldstation.com,+1 757-357-7700,american,"Gluten Free Options, Vegan Options, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,0,0,0

The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

1e4eab6e-fee2-4b80-93b9-c0f6525a794b,subway,"The story of Subway started over 50 years ago when Dr. Peter Buck, a nuclear physicist, changed the life of a student with a few simple words, ""Let's open a submarine sandwich shop."" It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

After three years in the food service industry Bill decided in the fall of 1982 to open his own restaurant in the resort area of Virginia Beach. Heavily influenced by the Beatles when growing up, thanks to his two older sisters who listened to their records all the time, he decided to name it 'Abbey Road' after the last album the Beatles recorded (although 'Let It Be' was the last released) before they split up in 1970 (thanks, Yoko). Many national, regional, and local musicians have performed at Abbey Road since 1982, including: Richie Havens - the man who opened Woodstock, Ronee Blakely - toured with Bob Dylan, Livingston Taylor - James' brother, The Ventures -theme from Hawaii Five-O, Rick Roberts of Firefall, - wrote & sang many of their #1 hits, Robert Hunter of The Grateful Dead, Robbin Thompson & The Robbin Thompson Band, Gove Scrivener, Lewis McGehee - toured with Bruce Hornsby, Lisa Noel, Mike Proffit & The Mike Proffitt Band, David Petretto, Keller Williams, Suzy & The Naturals, Catapult, T.K.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://www.subway.com,+1 540-408-0745,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Adelmo Micheli and his son, Sergio, opened the place in 1970, later Sergio and his wife Pilar ran it, and recently their son Richard, a Culinary Institute of America grad, has taken the torch. The old world feel -- think dark wood, gilded mirrors, and brocade boudoir chairs -- strikes a nostalgic chord with older couples and extended families with children who frequent the place and become regulars. They come for classic Italian fare -- many of the plates are from longtime family recipes. Pastas include lasagna bolognese, and linguine with Ligurian pesto. More substantial plates range from dishes like veal marsala, with wine and mushrooms, or chicken piccata with lemon and capers, to rosemary-crusted lamb chops with black olive sauce.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 540-341-7500,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Daniele and Gerard hesitated for three months and then decided, ""yaca le faire,"" a contraction of the French phrase ""il n'y a qu'a le faire,"" which basically means, ""let's do it."" They called the restaurant Le Yaca as a gag, but the name caught on with customers who were amused by the pun and contributed to the restaurant's lore by inventing ""yaca-isms"" of their own: yaca y aller (let's go). Daniele came to the United States and opened Le Yaca in Williamsburg. Daniel Abid bought Le Yaca in 2001.

The menu at Tom Yum District is set up choose-your-path fashion, with the first decision being a base. Pick rice or noodles before going on to the protein like grilled steak or chicken. Next is a sauce like the house made Tom Yum or the less spicy lemongrass ginger. Finally, customize the dish with an assortment of topping options like cucumber relish, Thai omelet, Asian mixed greens or crushed peanuts.",,,http://www.tomyumdistrict.com/,+1 703-528-8424,"thai, asian","Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options",1.0,0,0,0

In 1981, they bought Plaza Pizza & by 1994, it was remodeled & reinvented to become Malek's Pizza Palace. Arguably, the first restaurant in Springfield, VA to offer dine-in, take-out & delivery. Joseph kept the restaurant open until 10 PM, but the demand was so high that he started to stay open until 11 pm, then 12 am & eventually 4 am. Joseph never had the heart to turn a customer away. Often times, Joseph's children Elizabeth & Jonathan would sell pizza slices, coffee & hot chocolate to customers stuck in traffic during snow storms. Jonathan has been a part of Malek's since the age of nine and became a partner in 1995. Flipping pizzas high in the air, cooking Italian/Greek Specialties & perfecting the array of international dishes is his focus. In 2004 Jonathan wed Vivian.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/9907,+1 757-228-5700,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 757-673-1234,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/hampton/1114-big-bethel-rd,+1 757-827-1697,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Peter still kitchen hops from each restaurant with his name on the logo, however his masterful Szechuan cooking techniques are here to stay.",,,http://www.peterchangrestaurant.com,+1 804-728-1820,"chinese, asian",,0.0,0,0,0

The cost was devastatingly high, and in the few days of that battle, 5,300 Confederate troops and 12,600 Federal troops were killed, wounded or missing. Almost two-thirds of them fell before the wall trying to take Marye's Heights.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/chesapeake/632-grassfield-pkwy,+1 757-312-8940,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/springfield/6691-backlick-road,+1 703-639-0200,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/10754,+1 540-216-7937,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/fredericksburg/525-jefferson-davie-hwy,+1 540-371-7966,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://subway.com,+1 540-382-8115,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

The decision of what spices to use (and in what proportions) to concoct a perfect masala for a given dish depends on, among others, whether the dish includes meat, vegetables or fish and on the culinary origins of the dish. This process of creating a perfect mix to add just the right spice and flavor to different dishes is something of an art in itself, which our Chef, Ram Thapa, has mastered over years of training and exploration.

That's when he decided to change that with Brisket Taco Co.A Note From Our Owner:""As this wonderful journey of life has brought me to Staunton, I have struggled to find the type of food that reminds me of home. I'm looking forward to bringing the idea and concept that I created back in Dallas just before the pandemic hit. I love that I get to do this in my new hometown and share with those that would like to learn about or be reminded of the taste of Texas!

We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better. Our mission, to this day, is to inspire a healthier lifestyle by serving amazing food and smoothies...with a bit of tropical fun.",,,https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/,+1 757-546-7070,american,"salad, smoothie",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/chesapeake/109-gainsborough-square,+1 757-547-3629,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

The first location on the corner of 21st Street and Atlantic Avenue, built in 1968, was an instant success! Patrons saw their orders being baked right in front of their eyes and passersby caught the tantalizing scent of pizza that wafted through the storefront window. It didn't take long before the Chicho's pizza + beer combo made the location infamous as 'The Locals' Favorite. Its popularity heightened even more when renowned bands would stop by for a slice or two after concerts! In operation since 1968, we are still committed to its core values of freshness, quality, and simply great tasting pizza!",,,http://chichospizza.com,+1 757-548-2442,"american, italian","salad, bar",0.0,0,1,0

So, we designed an open floor plan to allow our guests to mingle, just as Marty did back in his day. Marty loved baseball as a child and played for City College of New York in the late 40's. He later took a liking to golf, although, according to mom, was never any good at the game. We think he just used golf as an excuse to schmooze with clients and hang out with friends.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

After serving in the US Army, he moved to Virginia and realized that there were no shabu shabu restaurants in the area. Determined to share his passion for this unique style of dining, he set out to create his own restaurant. It wasn't an easy journey - it took two years to learn the craft and build the restaurant. Thankfully, he had a knowledgeable partner, Wayne Atchley, who had been operating shabu shabu restaurants in California for nearly 30 years. Finally, in 2016, their hard work paid off and they opened their very own shabu shabu restaurant in Virginia. From the beginning, their customers loved the concept and were incredibly supportive of their business.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

The calm gulf waters, friends enjoying games in the sand and a need for replenishment from the warm Florida sun. We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations. Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/sterling/20789-great-falls-plz,+1 703-430-3803,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Our business plan so to speak. Not corporate. Not rigid. Just a place where a family can enjoy themselves and leave with a smile. This awesome and super complexTM business plan led to the opening of our Lynnhaven Parkway Pop's Diner Co. location in 2005. With the great support of the community and our customers we opened our second location on Greenbrier Parkway in 2009. It all started when our father, Pops as we call him, would cook breakfast for us every Sunday morning without exception. To our horror, we found out that some of our friends and acquaintances weren't as lucky! They didn't get to enjoy grilled sausages, fresh cut homefries, and buttered biscuits every Sunday. They would go to a corporate breakfast and eat cold eggs, soggy pancakes, and get service with an attitude. So being the humanitarians and general all around good guys that we are, we decided to form our above mentioned awesome and super complexTM business plan. That's our story and we're sticking to it. Our diner is a place of no pretensions, where locals hang out, chat with others, watch the staff have fun and have a great meal - the best breakfast in Virginia Beach. It's the perfect place to bring out-of-town visitors. They'll get a real home cooking experience—great omelets, grilled sandwiches, homemade specials, in a clean and family friendly atmosphere.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/10511,+1 703-670-5555,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://www.subway.com,+1 757-686-3116,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/8823,+1 757-965-3388,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/arlington/2461-south-clark-street,+1 703-566-8701,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better. Our mission, to this day, is to inspire a healthier lifestyle by serving amazing food and smoothies...with a bit of tropical fun.",,,https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/,+1 540-635-3965,american,"salad, smoothie",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/richmond/1700-ashland-road,+1 804-784-2615,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/virginia-beach/1817-london-bridge-rd,+1 757-301-2124,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

A striking new walnut bar top and custom-built parquet walnut tables with comfortable armchairs make it the place to meet after work in Smithfield. The Dining Room at the Smithfield Inn retains its elegance but the atmosphere is lighter and airier. For a special occasion, for any occasion, this is gourmet dining at its finest. And our stunning, newly decorated Parlor invites you to curl up with a good book, enjoy a card game or sip a glass of wine.",,,http://smithfieldinn.net,+1 757-357-1752,american,bar,0.0,0,1,0

Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better. Our mission, to this day, is to inspire a healthier lifestyle by serving amazing food and smoothies...with a bit of tropical fun.",,,https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/,+1 540-951-4000,american,"salad, smoothie",0.0,1,0,1

Second, we wanted to give our customers a good value. We have 3 kids and know what it costs to raise a family. We were determined to keep our profit margin low and our waste down so that we could keep our prices reasonable. Finally, we wanted to make you feel at home at The Coffee Shoppe and we figured that if we treated our customers like a guest in our home then we couldn't go wrong. Our baristas are the best and will do whatever it takes to make your experience memorable.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/10591,+1 757-410-9616,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/9760,+1 703-393-7111,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/4893,+1 540-343-0003,,,0.0,0,1,0

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Many of Meaza's dishes are flavored with purified, spiced Ethiopian butter, from the ye beg kikil—lamb stew in spicy sauce—to the kifto—ground beef traditionally served raw or rare and mixed with cardamom and a mitmita spice blend.",http://www.facebook.com/meazarestaurant,,http://www.meazaethiopiancuisine.com/,+1 703-820-2870,"ethiopian, american, african","Vegan Options, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,0,0,0

The global chain that Little Caesars is today began with a blind date between Mike Ilitch and Marian Bayoff that was arranged by Mike's father in 1954. Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/2265,+1 434-792-5555,,,0.0,0,1,0

You can get a whole or half duck. It is served with hoisin sauce, spring onions and homemade crepes.",,,http://asiangardenchinese.com,+1 571-248-6608,"indian, japanese, chinese, asian",,0.0,0,0,0

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut.

As he moved up the career chain, Jon learned what separates the country's best grocers from their competitors. During this time, Jon's son Nathan also decided to get into the grocery business. But Nathan is an entrepreneur at heart; he needed to be his own boss. Along the way he had developed a passion for craft beers. Craft brewers have the same obsession for uncompromising quality that Nathan and Jon developed in the grocery business. They believe beer should be created by impassioned brewmasters, not by accountants and marketers. Enter The Casual Pint. With Nathan providing the dream, Jon providing the capital, and both providing business expertise, they opened their first location in Knoxville in 2011. Today you can find us across the country, providing a relaxed atmosphere with rotating taps, delicious food, and an appreciation for all things craft beer.",,,https://virginiabeach.thecasualpint.com,+1 757-689-6296,american,,0.0,0,0,0

They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut.

The age-old custom was a popular tradition in the early days of Yard House as guests drank beer from the signature three-foot glass vessel. Today, guests can sip their favorites from the half yard, pint glass, 23-ounce nonic glass and beer samplers.

They looked in many places from Charleston, SC to Jamestown, VA to Manteo, NC. All of the places viewed had a fault or two that kept the brothers from diving in. In the winter of 2018, Surry County, never before on the radar, approached the brothers about taking over The Surry Seafood Co. and they were all ears.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Throughout the mid 80's to the late 90's the operation continued to expand but also continued to change in its management structure.

We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://www.subway.com/en-us,+1 703-472-2036,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 757-427-4118,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

Opened in October 2005, Upper Crust set out on its mission. Fast forward a few years, and the response from the community has been favorable indeed. The Wyndhurst store was voted Best Pizza 3 times in the local newspaper poll, a second store was opened, and a mobile truck was added to the operations.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Tomatoes are rushed from the field and fresh-packed within six hours, never from concentrate. To make a pizza that keeps people talking, eating, and sharing with family & friends, you have to start in the neighborhood. At least that's the way we saw it in 1988 when we opened the very first location. Back then, Founder Varol Ablak started a tradition of taste that would eventually deliver Vocelli Pizza into the national spotlight. Founded on artisan recipes, we earned a distinct reputation for quality taste for the serious pizza eater. Starting with our daily hand-tossed dough, mixed with extra virgin olive oil, our award-winning pies are then topped with our private-labeled sauce, made from freshly-packed, vine-ripened tomatoes and covered with 100% Real Wisconsin mozzarella cheese. Each pie is then finished with only market-fresh toppings - from the little pepperoni that cups and curls on each pizza, to snow white mushrooms and crisp green peppers, to savory pepperoni and farm fresh sausage.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.
