Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/norfolk/1901-colley-avenue,+1 757-622-6200,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Craft is food that inspires and surprises the palate. Craft is service that delights and exceeds expectations. Most importantly, craft means championing love and integrity in every aspect of what we do. Craft beer, for some time, was an exclusive culture; it existed in the basements of homebrewers, on niche blogs, and in obscure, tucked away bars. For outsiders, craft beer can be intimidating. In fact, we're still learning. After all, it's a big brewhouse out there. City Tap believes that craft beer should be accessible to everyone. In Philadelphia 2010, we saw an opportunity to bring craft beer to the people. With a wide, open bar, a huge selection of taps, an extremely readable draft list, and regional (dare we say exceptional) cuisine, our sudsy dream became a reality.",,,https://www.citytap.com/location/loudoun/,+1 571-510-3850,american,burger,0.0,0,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/virginia-beach/300-28th-st,+1 757-425-4666,american,"salad, dinner, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that were just plain embarrassing to them today, the cousins decided to try something a bit unique, A/B testing their way to the perfect cookie. They would take the exact same cookie, change out one ingredient like chocolate chips and randomly visit local gas stations and grocery stores simply asking one question ""Which one of these two cookies is the best?"" They continued this testing on ingredients and cooking methods until they came up with what they believe is the world's best chocolate chip cookie.The very first Crumbl opened in Logan, UT while Sawyer was attending Utah State University (go Aggies).

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/suffolk/6550-hampton-roads-parkway,+1 757-483-6355,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Early in 1983, Ron and Tina Pack were on a boat cruise with friends in the upper Chesapeake Bay. During that cruise, it became apparent that their newly adopted town of Smithfield was every bit as nice as the popular destination points of the upper bay communities. It became their dream to provide a truly exceptional experience for their guests and to establish Smithfield as a historic destination just as nice as neighboring waterfront communities. In 1994 The Lighthouse was added, and then In 2001 and 2003 respectively, a new generation of Pack's, Randy and Brian, became fully involved with the business. With the addition of these two brothers, they expanded Smithfield Station with the creation of The Lodge with luxury suites, conference space and boardwalk shops.",,,http://smithfieldstation.com,+1 757-357-7700,american,"Gluten Free Options, Vegan Options, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,0,0,0

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

1e4eab6e-fee2-4b80-93b9-c0f6525a794b,subway,"The story of Subway started over 50 years ago when Dr. Peter Buck, a nuclear physicist, changed the life of a student with a few simple words, ""Let's open a submarine sandwich shop."" It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

After three years in the food service industry Bill decided in the fall of 1982 to open his own restaurant in the resort area of Virginia Beach. Heavily influenced by the Beatles when growing up, thanks to his two older sisters who listened to their records all the time, he decided to name it 'Abbey Road' after the last album the Beatles recorded (although 'Let It Be' was the last released) before they split up in 1970 (thanks, Yoko). Many national, regional, and local musicians have performed at Abbey Road since 1982, including: Richie Havens - the man who opened Woodstock, Ronee Blakely - toured with Bob Dylan, Livingston Taylor - James' brother, The Ventures -theme from Hawaii Five-O, Rick Roberts of Firefall, - wrote & sang many of their #1 hits, Robert Hunter of The Grateful Dead, Robbin Thompson & The Robbin Thompson Band, Gove Scrivener, Lewis McGehee - toured with Bruce Hornsby, Lisa Noel, Mike Proffit & The Mike Proffitt Band, David Petretto, Keller Williams, Suzy & The Naturals, Catapult, T.K.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://www.subway.com,+1 540-408-0745,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Adelmo Micheli and his son, Sergio, opened the place in 1970, later Sergio and his wife Pilar ran it, and recently their son Richard, a Culinary Institute of America grad, has taken the torch. The old world feel -- think dark wood, gilded mirrors, and brocade boudoir chairs -- strikes a nostalgic chord with older couples and extended families with children who frequent the place and become regulars. They come for classic Italian fare -- many of the plates are from longtime family recipes. Pastas include lasagna bolognese, and linguine with Ligurian pesto. More substantial plates range from dishes like veal marsala, with wine and mushrooms, or chicken piccata with lemon and capers, to rosemary-crusted lamb chops with black olive sauce.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 540-341-7500,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Daniele and Gerard hesitated for three months and then decided, ""yaca le faire,"" a contraction of the French phrase ""il n'y a qu'a le faire,"" which basically means, ""let's do it."" They called the restaurant Le Yaca as a gag, but the name caught on with customers who were amused by the pun and contributed to the restaurant's lore by inventing ""yaca-isms"" of their own: yaca y aller (let's go). Daniele came to the United States and opened Le Yaca in Williamsburg. Daniel Abid bought Le Yaca in 2001.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 757-673-1234,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/hampton/1114-big-bethel-rd,+1 757-827-1697,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

This quirky shop was doing well, but the determined pair knew they could always do better. In 1977, they decided to start serving sandwiches to their curious, collecting customers. As time passed, the little antique shop slowly turned into the neighborhood lunchtime getaway. With lines reaching out the door and around the corner, customers enjoyed toasty warm sandwiches, homemade desserts and even live music in this unique atmosphere.In 1996, entrepreneur Bryant Keil purchased the original shop and set out to spread the Potbelly love across the country, creating shops with the same neighborhood feel as the original.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/chesapeake/632-grassfield-pkwy,+1 757-312-8940,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

The global chain that Little Caesars is today began with a blind date between Mike Ilitch and Marian¬†Bayoff¬†that was arranged by Mike's father in 1954. Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/11133,+1 757-397-1979,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

After many years of hard work they enlarged the building to its size today. But after years of neglect by renters the family got together and decided to take it back!

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/fredericksburg/525-jefferson-davie-hwy,+1 540-371-7966,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://subway.com,+1 540-382-8115,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

The decision of what spices to use (and in what proportions) to concoct a perfect masala for a given dish depends on, among others, whether the dish includes meat, vegetables or fish and on the culinary origins of the dish.

The calm gulf waters, friends enjoying games in the sand and a need for replenishment from the warm Florida sun. We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations. Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/chesapeake/109-gainsborough-square,+1 757-547-3629,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

The calm gulf waters, friends enjoying games in the sand and a need for replenishment from the warm Florida sun. We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations. Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better. Our mission, to this day, is to inspire a healthier lifestyle by serving amazing food and smoothies...with a bit of tropical fun.",,,https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/,+1 757-964-7771,american,"salad, smoothie",0.0,1,0,1

Patrons saw their orders being baked right in front of their eyes and passersby caught the tantalizing scent of pizza that wafted through the storefront window.

Mom always said that when dining out, he would enjoy each course at a different table because he loved to talk! So, we designed an open floor plan to allow our guests to mingle, just as Marty did back in his day. Marty loved baseball as a child and played for City College of New York in the late 40's. He later took a liking to golf, although, according to mom, was never any good at the game. We think he just used golf as an excuse to schmooze with clients and hang out with friends. Marty's Grill strives to provide the highest quality food and service, in a relaxed atmosphere meant to be shared with family and friends, both new and old.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/warrenton/6437-lee-highway,+1 540-878-2085,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

After serving in the US Army, he moved to Virginia and realized that there were no shabu shabu restaurants in the area. Determined to share his passion for this unique style of dining, he set out to create his own restaurant. It wasn't an easy journey - it took two years to learn the craft and build the restaurant. Thankfully, he had a knowledgeable partner, Wayne Atchley, who had been operating shabu shabu restaurants in California for nearly 30 years. Finally, in 2016, their hard work paid off and they opened their very own shabu shabu restaurant in Virginia. From the beginning, their customers loved the concept and were incredibly supportive of their business. Thanks to their dedication and love of Japanese cuisine, the restaurant has become a beloved staple in the community, providing a unique dining experience and bringing a taste of California to Virginia.",,,https://www.calishabu.com,+1 571-210-2252,"japanese, asian","Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options, soup",0.0,0,0,0

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 540-491-9935,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/sterling/20789-great-falls-plz,+1 703-430-3803,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Our business plan so to speak. Not corporate. Not rigid. Just a place where a family can enjoy themselves and leave with a smile. This awesome and super complexTM business plan led to the opening of our Lynnhaven Parkway Pop's Diner Co. location in 2005. With the great support of the community and our customers we opened our second location on Greenbrier Parkway in 2009. It all started when our father, Pops as we call him, would cook breakfast for us every Sunday morning without exception. To our horror, we found out that some of our friends and acquaintances weren't as lucky! They didn't get to enjoy grilled sausages, fresh cut homefries, and buttered biscuits every Sunday. They would go to a corporate breakfast and eat cold eggs, soggy pancakes, and get service with an attitude. So being the humanitarians and general all around good guys that we are, we decided to form our above mentioned awesome and super complexTM business plan. That's our story and we're sticking to it. Our diner is a place of no pretensions, where locals hang out, chat with others, watch the staff have fun and have a great meal - the best breakfast in Virginia Beach. It's the perfect place to bring out-of-town visitors. They'll get a real home cooking experience‚Äîgreat omelets, grilled sandwiches, homemade specials, in a clean and family friendly atmosphere.

Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/1880,+1 804-741-6333,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,http://www.subway.com,+1 757-686-3116,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/9849,+1 571-918-0222,italian,salad,0.0,1,0,1

We believe that ""service"" isn't just about taking the guest's order and serving their food. ""It's the attention to the small things that gives the guest the feeling of importance."" We want every guest to feel special. Unlike the chain restaurants, at Bulls, the owners and managers walk the dining room checking on every guest to make sure that they are enjoying their dining experience. In addition to the personalized service at Bulls, you can expect equal attention given to the food we serve. In the initial years, Bulls started with a very limited menu specializing in prime rib, steaks, chicken, and sandwiches. Over the years we have added many dishes. The menu has evolved to include: seafood, tex-mex, pork, salads. Al",,,http://www.bullssteakhouse.com,+1 434-385-7581,american,steakhouse,0.0,0,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/arlington/2461-south-clark-street,+1 703-566-8701,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

97012cea-3f46-4fc5-a522-3fe6137a19bb,firehouse subs,"Growing up in a family that is both entrepreneurial and built on more than 200 years of firefighting heritage, it seems we were destined to start Firehouse Subs. Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,https://www.firehousesubs.com/store-locator/store/oi5gpedk5xpscccn9b4jc5,+1 703-729-3473,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/richmond/1700-ashland-road,+1 804-784-2615,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/virginia-beach/1817-london-bridge-rd,+1 757-301-2124,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Miller fancies himself as a gastronome and ""foodie"" extensively, exploring the food culture of many regions of this and other countries. One of his food explorations in 2008, centered around the vibrantly, flavorful and spicy cuisine of Louisiana. He so enjoyed the Southern flavor profile, and spin on French Seafood, that he found himself often cooking many of the specialties he first had in New Orleans, for his friends and family. Miller decided that he would open his first restaurant so everyone could come and enjoy the ""Cajun Experience"" that his friends and family enjoyed so much. His pledge to all is that each Hook & Reel will only use the finest and freshest seafood, coupled with fresh garlic, lemon pepper, herbs and spices, and chili powder.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth. Today, the SUBWAY brand is the world's largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 40,000 locations worldwide.",,,https://restaurants.subway.com/united-states/va/alexandria/3674-king-st,+1 703-931-3700,american,"salad, dinner",0.0,1,0,1

Other popular entrees at Jose Tequilas include the chorizo Americano bowl loaded with spicy Mexican sausage and covered in melty cheese, as well as the marinated margarita chicken served atop black beans and fried tortilla strips. The fried egg huevos rancheros is another favorite. The fried ice cream, covered in whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles and a cherry, makes a delightfully sweet end to your dinner. Be sure to enjoy one of the famous margaritas at Jose Tequilas, like the raspberry liquor, cranberry juice and Sprite-laced ""bandita.""",http://www.facebook.com/josetequilasmexicanogrillandcantina,,http://josetequilasmexicanogrillandcantina.com/,+1 757-471-2791,mexican,"Gluten Free Options, Vegetarian Friendly",1.0,0,0,0

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,http://order.firehousesubs.com/menu,+1 540-710-7827,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

Anyone who remembers the historic William Rand Tavern will appreciate that it's now one big open space for casual dining. A striking new walnut bar top and custom-built parquet walnut tables with comfortable armchairs make it the place to meet after work in Smithfield. The Dining Room at the Smithfield Inn retains its elegance but the atmosphere is lighter and airier. For a special occasion, for any occasion, this is gourmet dining at its finest.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

 Chef-owner Wataru Mizuno feels blessed to be a sushi chef in a culinary trifecta like Virginia Beach. Mizuno and his team take advantage of the restaurant's access to local sources by artfully composing daily specials that feature fresh shrimp, yellowfin tuna, bluefin tuna, flounder, blue crabs and oysters, to name a few. 
 The hook's simple. Mizuno resists complicated sauces and excessive ingredients. Instead, he flavors scallops from the world famous Chesapeake Bay, adding nothing more, at times, than a dash of citrus and a pinch of sea salt. Wataru Mizuno: Chef/Owner
 Born in Japan, Wataru Mizuno received his formal training in Tokyo, as an apprentice under master Teruo Sato.",,,http://www.mizunosushi.com/,+1 757-422-1200,"japanese, asian","Gluten Free Options, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,0,0,0

Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/9995,+1 540-786-0080,,,0.0,0,0,0

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

As he moved up the career chain, Jon learned what separates the country's best grocers from their competitors. During this time, Jon's son Nathan also decided to get into the grocery business. But Nathan is an entrepreneur at heart; he needed to be his own boss. Along the way he had developed a passion for craft beers. Craft brewers have the same obsession for uncompromising quality that Nathan and Jon developed in the grocery business. They believe beer should be created by impassioned brewmasters, not by accountants and marketers. Enter The Casual Pint. With Nathan providing the dream, Jon providing the capital, and both providing business expertise, they opened their first location in Knoxville in 2011.

The global chain that Little Caesars is today began with a blind date between Mike Ilitch and Marian¬†Bayoff¬†that was arranged by Mike's father in 1954. Within just a matter of months, the couple was married. Mike and Marian Ilitch invested their life savings into their first pizza store in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The first franchise opened in Warren, Michigan in 1962. The business decision to expand through franchising paved the way for Little Caesars to become the fastest growing pizza chain in the U.S. and an internationally known brand.*Today, Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and 27 countries and territories.",,,https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/store/10332,+1 703-347-7766,italian,salad,0.0,1,1,1

We took our experience with brews and breweries and coupled it with a kitchen that creates culinary innovations to be enjoyed in an energetic atmosphere. The restaurant's name was derived from an early Colonial tradition of serving 36-inch tall glasses - or yards - to weary stagecoach drivers. The age-old custom was a popular tradition in the early days of Yard House as guests drank beer from the signature three-foot glass vessel. Today, guests can sip their favorites from the half yard, pint glass, 23-ounce nonic glass and beer samplers. Equal to our passion for what's trending in beer is our interest in what's cropping up on today's innovative menus. Executive Chef Carlito Jocson is always developing new ways to fuse globally inspired flavors with favorite American dishes, giving our menu a worldly yet familiar feel.",,,https://www.yardhouse.com/locations/va/virginia-beach/virginia-beach-town-center/8334,+1 757-490-9273,"american, asian","Gluten Free Options, bar, Vegan Options, Vegetarian Friendly",0.0,0,0,0

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

The calm gulf waters, friends enjoying games in the sand and a need for replenishment from the warm Florida sun. We started by blending fruit and vegetables together to create unique and refreshing smoothies. And customers lined up for our tasty creations. Then in 1997, we opened our first cafe in Tallahassee, Florida. Guests now had a place to sit and relax while we made their favorite smoothies, all with fresh ingredients. Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better. Our mission, to this day, is to inspire a healthier lifestyle by serving amazing food and smoothies...with a bit of tropical fun.",,,https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/,+1 540-217-2917,american,"salad, smoothie",0.0,1,0,1

And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Throughout the mid 80's to the late 90's the operation continued to expand but also continued to change in its management structure. Finally in 2005 the dairy operation was sold and the stores were closed. The family property was in danger of complete liquidation.

It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1K, and a business relationship was forged that changed the landscape of the fast food industry. The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow but one thing remained, their core values and principles. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops in Connecticut. From there, they began franchising, launching the brand into a period of remarkable growth.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike. As they say in the fire station, let's eat! - Chris Sorensen & Robin Sorensen, Co-Founders",,,https://www.firehousesubs.com/store-locator/store/ylxmqweebwdaycby9dk1gn,+1 757-539-0980,american,"dessert, deli, salad",0.0,1,0,0

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.

To make a pizza that keeps people talking, eating, and sharing with family & friends, you have to start in the neighborhood. At least that's the way we saw it in 1988 when we opened the very first location. Back then, Founder Varol Ablak started a tradition of taste that would eventually deliver Vocelli Pizza into the national spotlight. Founded on artisan recipes, we earned a distinct reputation for quality taste for the serious pizza eater. Starting with our daily hand-tossed dough, mixed with extra virgin olive oil, our award-winning pies are then topped with our private-labeled sauce, made from freshly-packed, vine-ripened tomatoes and covered with 100% Real Wisconsin mozzarella cheese. Each pie is then finished with only market-fresh toppings - from the little pepperoni that cups and curls on each pizza, to snow white mushrooms and crisp green peppers, to savory pepperoni and farm fresh sausage.

Two years later, we added a range of wholesome food options to complement our smoothies and our guest's day. With that, Tropical Smoothie Cafe was born. We started as a destination for flavor, and it's a proud heritage that we continue today. We are guided by a simple belief: when you eat better, you feel better.

Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

Of course we tried other things along the way to our American dream, but everything we experienced on our path led us to Firehouse Subs. Over 20 years after opening the first restaurant, with over 1,100 Firehouse Subs restaurants, we're convinced we're doing a few things right. Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls. It's a winning combination that satisfies ravenous appetites and the value conscious alike.

From that i started a passion for baking and began to make cakes and bars and brownies for my friends and church family, before i knew it i had a website and orders! The business grew so much that we had to convert my garage to another kitchen. I began to get contacts with business to make there cakes. One day my husband turned to me and said is this a hobbies or a career? I said a career and the next months to come i was looking for retail space. So thats the story of Scratch Bakery After one year of being in our retail space we moved to a larger space and thats where er are now!",,,http://itsmadefromscratch.com,+1 757-224-8430,,cafe,0.0,0,1,0

Turns out, people absolutely love the same things we do - the best meats, cheeses, and toppings we can find. People come back again and again to Firehouse Subs because, unlike other sub places, we steam our premium hand-sliced meats and cheeses, releasing a rush of flavors, then stuff a serving that's way over code on one of our toasted private recipe sub rolls.
